            I initially planned to study business but discovered my passion for
            computer science just before starting my first year at the
            University of Washington. Driven by a love for software development,
            I actively explore new technologies and apply my learning beyond the
            classroom. While I specialize in front-end development, I'm always
            eager to expand my skills and dive into other areas of the field.

            I learned basic Python syntax and started to self-teach myself data
            structures and algorithms to hone my problem solving skills. I spent
            6-8 hours a day tackling problems and ensured I perfected each type
            of problem before moving to the other.

            My first ever Hackathon introduced me to working with a team
            especially from the technical perspective. It also introduced me to
            new libraries and frameworks to materialize these ideas. My team and
            I made a web app called NextUp which simualted a queueing system to
            facilitate basketball games. We had a prototype on Figma that didn't
            match our actual web app though... lmao

            This tech entrepreneurship club introduced me to the ideation
            process of tech startups. I decided to create a barber app for
            college students called StyleSphere with React Native and Firebase
            console. This was the toughest learning curve for me to overcome as
            I didn't know where to start, was in tutorial hell, and so many
            things were foreign to me. Eventually, I was able to figure out
            basic React components, hooks, and firebase methods.

            Flew down to Riverside with some high school friends to compete in
            an MLH. Ate lots of good food and had a well-executed mobile app but
            the idea could've been a more specific and unique to address a
            general problem. We made a disaster relief app called LiftUp that
            hosted events for impactees (donation centers, shelters, etc.).

            After interviewing initally for a PM position, I was able to get a
            position as a develeoper for a startup called Eat Together (didn't
            get funding, now a project for students). Constructed surveys for
            user data, critiqued Figma prototypes, integrated Yelp API and added
            a recommendation feature for users.

            Currently creating a web app for iMuslims, an RSO designated for
            minorities in informatics. Consulted with them about technicality of
            their website and use my team's Figma prototype to create the whole
            web app.
